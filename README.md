Aura Sample Application.

This application is a simple java web application that I am using to play around with Aura.

The goal is to have a skeleton, working template of Aura and embedded Tomcat 7 that I can run both locally and on Heroku.

Current Status - 9/9/2013
- Added a few components to play with client eventing
- Simple model
- Security provider needs implementation
- Still having some trouble with CSS (ID-10-T error I imagine)
- Simple component to look at some UI elements
